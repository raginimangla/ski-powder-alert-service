Whether you're developing a mobile app, a web service, or integrating into a larger system, the Powder Alert service provides the tools you need to keep your users informed and ready for the slopes.

The Powder Alert service is a simple cloud-based API. With its two main resources, **users** and **resorts**, the API allows you to:

* Create and manage user profiles.
* Retrieve detailed information about specific resorts.
* Set up and customize powder alerts based on snowfall thresholds.
* Receive notifications when your specified conditions are met.

## Authenticate

Users authenticate into the service using their username and password.

## Base URL

All requests to the Powder Alert API should be directed to the base URL: <https://api.powderalert.com>

This base URL is the root endpoint for all API interactions, with specific resource paths appended to it.

## API Reference

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When running a local test, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.

* [Users Resource](../api/user-pa.md)
* [Resorts Resource](../api/resort-pa.md)
* [Create a user](../api/users-create-user.md)
* [Get user details for all users](../api/users-get-all-users.md)

## Error Handling

The Powder Alert service follows standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call. Here is an overview of common HTTP status codes and their meanings, along with typical reasons for each code.

Operations that execute successfully will return `2xx` codes. Operations that result in an error due to a problem on the client's side, such as invalid input, will return standard `4xx` codes. Operations that result in an error due to a problem with the server will return `5xx` codes.

### HTTP Status Code Summary

This section summarizes the most frequent HTTP status codes returned by the API and describes their common causes.

| **HTTP Status Code** | Status Text           | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Common Causes                                                                                                                                             |
